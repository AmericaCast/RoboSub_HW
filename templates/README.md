# templates

Projects meant to serve as template for a full board. PCB trace/space (6mil/6mil) and vias (12mil/24mil) chosen to be compatible with the following processes.

- Bay Area Circuits Standard Capability
- OSH Park 2 Layer
- JLCPCB 2 Layer

`libs` is linked using a relative path so it may need modification depending on folder structure.

To use, just copy one of the templates, rename the `.pro`, `.kicad_pcb`, and `.sch` files, and start designing.
